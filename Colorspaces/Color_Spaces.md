# What are color spaces?

A color space is a specific way of representing colors in a digital image, which is defined by a mathematical model that maps colors as perceived by the human eye to
a set of numerical values that can be stored and processed by a computer. Following are the some of the most used color spaces in current time:

  * RGB (Red, Green, Blue):
    > The most used color space and represents color as a combination of red, green, and blue values.
    
    > Used in computer displays, cameras, and digital devices.
    
    > Red - (255, 0, 0), Green - (0, 255, 0), Blue - (0, 0, 255)
