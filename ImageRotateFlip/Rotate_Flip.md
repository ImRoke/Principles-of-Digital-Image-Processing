# What is the need of Image Transformations?

Image transformations are essential techniques play a crucial role in various image processing and computer vision tasks, enabling us to manipulate and analyze 
images effectively. Image transformations Here, we will explore the fundamentals of image rotations, flips, and even create our custom image rotator using Python. 
We will delve into the mathematical equations that underlie these transformations, as well as practical implementations using Python libraries.

## Image Rotations

Image rotations involve changing the orientation of an image by a certain angle. The rotation can be either clockwise or counterclockwise. To achieve image 
rotations, we use a transformation matrix.

For a given angle θ, the transformation matrix M is as follows:

```
| cos(θ)  -sin(θ) |
| sin(θ)   cos(θ) |

Here, the angle is measured in radians.
```

### Implementation using Python and NumPy

In our Python implementation, we use NumPy to handle the matrix operations. By multiplying the transformation matrix with the image's coordinate points, we 
achieve the desired rotation.

```python
import numpy as np

def rotate_image(image, angle):
    angle_rad = angle * np.pi / 180.0
    height, width = image.shape[:2]
    center_x, center_y = width / 2, height / 2

    # Calculate the new image size after rotation and ensure integers
    new_width = int(abs(width * np.cos(angle_rad)) + abs(height * np.sin(angle_rad)))
    new_height = int(abs(width * np.sin(angle_rad)) + abs(height * np.cos(angle_rad)))

    # Create an empty image to store the rotated image
    rotated_image = np.zeros((new_height, new_width, 3), dtype=np.uint8)

    # Calculate the offset to center the rotated image
    offset_x = (new_width - width) // 2
    offset_y = (new_height - height) // 2

    for y in range(height):
        for x in range(width):
            new_x = int((x - center_x) * np.cos(angle_rad) - (y - center_y) * np.sin(angle_rad)) + center_x
            new_y = int((x - center_x) * np.sin(angle_rad) + (y - center_y) * np.cos(angle_rad)) + center_y
            if 0 <= new_x < new_width and 0 <= new_y < new_height:
                rotated_image[new_y + offset_y, new_x + offset_x] = image[y, x]

    return rotated_image
```

## Image Flipping

Image flipping involves inverting the image's pixel order along a specified axis. There are two types of flipping: horizontal and vertical.

Horizontal Flip (Mirror across the vertical axis):
```
| 1  0 |
| 0 -1 |
```

Vertical Flip (Mirror across the horizontal axis):
```
| -1  0 |
|  0  1 |
```

### Implementation using Python and NumPy

In this implementation, we use NumPy to perform the pixel order inversion and create flipped images.

```python
import numpy as np

def flip_horizontal(image):
    height, width = image.shape[:2]
    flipped_image = np.zeros_like(image)
    for y in range(height):
        flipped_image[y] = image[y][::-1]
    return flipped_image

def flip_vertical(image):
    height, width = image.shape[:2]
    flipped_image = np.zeros_like(image)
    for y in range(height):
        flipped_image[height - 1 - y] = image[y]
    return flipped_image
```

## Custom Image Rotator


To create a custom image rotator, we combine image rotations with user-defined angles. The angle can be any value, positive or negative.

### Implementation using Python and NumPy

In our custom image rotator implementation, we build upon the image rotation function and allow the user to input any desired angle.

```python
import numpy as np

class CustomImageRotator:
    def __init__(self, image_path):
        self.image_path = image_path
        self.im = cv2.imread(self.image_path)

    def rotate(self, angle):
        angle_rad = angle * np.pi / 180.0
        height, width = self.im.shape[:2]
        center_x, center_y = width / 2, height / 2
        # use the implementation similar to image rotation as above
```

## Uses of Image Rotations and Flips:

  * Image Alignment:
      > Image rotations are used to align images for image stitching, panorama creation, and registration of images from different perspectives or orientations.

  * Augmentation in Machine Learning:
      > Data augmentation involves applying various transformations, including rotations and flips, to augment the training dataset.
      > This process increases the dataset's diversity, leading to better model generalization.

  * Image Transforms:
      > Image rotations can be used as part of image transformations to apply artistic effects, simulate camera perspective changes, or create visually appealing
      visualizations.

  * Text Recognition:
      > Image rotations can help improve OCR (Optical Character Recognition) accuracy by aligning text regions in images for better recognition.

  * Image Preprocessing:
      > Image rotations are used to correct the orientation of scanned documents or images captured from various sources.

## Limitations:

* Interpolation Artifacts:
    > Depending on the interpolation method used during rotation, images may exhibit blurring or jagged edges, particularly when rotating by non-integer angles
    or very large angles.

* Information Loss:
    > Excessive rotations can lead to information loss or distortion, especially when rotating close to 180 or 360 degrees.

* Crop and Fill:
    > Rotations may result in blank regions outside the original image boundaries. These regions can be filled with zeros, interpolated values, or cropped, which
    might affect the overall image appearance.

* Performance:
    > Implementations that use loops and basic array slicing, while instructive, may be slower for large images compared to optimized libraries like NumPy or OpenCV.
