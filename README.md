# Principles-of-Digital-Image-Processing
The basic principles of the image processing are being explained through OpenCV and Python. 

## You are at the right place to start yearning the DIP

First things first, we should know What is Digital Image and then processing of it.

## What actually a Digital Image?

A digital image is a 2D representation of visual objects or scenes that are stored in digital form, typically as a series of numerical values. These are made up of a grid of square or rectangular area of uniform tiny picture elements called pixels, each of which is assigned a color or grayscale based on the format it has been stored (like 8 bit, 16 bit etc). The resolution of an image is determined by the number of pixels in the grid. 

The higher the resolution, the more pixels it has, and the more detail that can be displayed in the image. Digital images are widely used in many fields, including photography, design, medical imaging, astronomy, security, engineering and science, among others. 

## Digital Image Processing (DIP)

DIP is a rapidly growing field and driven by the use of computer algorithms to enhance, restore and extract information from the images by using mathematical and computational techniques. Which includes linear algebra, calculus, probability theory, and machine learning.
